🔍 How It Works
Homepage (index.html)
Loads products dynamically from localStorage.
If empty, displays:
"Currently, there are no products displayed! To add products, go to the Admin Panel."

Admin Panel (admin.html)
Add new products with images, price, and stock details. Updates sync instantly to the homepage.

Cart System
Add items to the cart, view them in real-time, and proceed to simulated checkout.
